# CPSC 350: Data Structures Projects

C++ projects completed in Fall 2024 at Chapman University for **CPSC 350: Data Structures**.  
Each project demonstrates core computer science concepts, including object-oriented programming, custom data structures, and algorithm implementation.

## Project List

- **robber-language-translator**  
  Translates American English text from a plain text file into Robber Language (Rövarspråket) using character-by-character encoding logic.

- **not-so-super-mario-bros**  
  Text-based adventure game where Mario collects coins, gains power-ups, and battles bosses across multiple worlds. Demonstrates OOP, game logic, and file I/O.

- **event-speaker-visibility**  
  Analyzes the seating arrangement of event attendees and determines which can see the speaker using a monotonically decreasing stack.

- **genetic-palindromes**  
  Reads DNA sequences from a file and identifies all possible genetic palindromes using a custom doubly linked list implementation.

- **scare-games-tournament**  
  Simulates the Scare Games tournament using binary trees to manage single and double-elimination formats. Outputs the tournament structure as a DOT file.

- **kruskal-minimum-spanning-tree**  
  Computes the Minimum Spanning Tree of a weighted graph using Kruskal’s algorithm with a custom priority queue.
