  Analyzes the seating arrangement of event attendees and determines which can see the speaker using a monotonically decreasing stack.

- **genetic-palindromes**  
  Reads DNA sequences from a file and identifies all possible genetic palindromes using a custom doubly linked list implementation.

- **scare-games-tournament**  
  Simulates the Scare Games tournament using binary trees to manage single and double-elimination formats. Outputs the tournament structure as a DOT file.

- **kruskal-minimum-spanning-tree**  
  Computes the Minimum Spanning Tree of a weighted graph using Kruskalâ€™s algorithm with a custom priority queue.
