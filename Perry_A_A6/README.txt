CHATGPT, PROMPT ASKED: how to remove all items from one set and put into another set
CHATGPT, PROMPT ASKED: this prints as ints, they need to be doubles, the info in input file is doubles: 
    *copied my processFile() and printAdjMatrix() as is currently minus setprecision() line line*
CHATGPT, PROMPT ASKED: *copied and pasted error code below, and was given the -std=c++11 addition for compile command
    ./WGraph.h:40:24: error: no member named 'tuple' in namespace 'std' MinPQueue<std::tuple<VertexID, VertexID, double> > m_pq;
For overview on sets: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/set-in-cpp-stl/
Used clang++ LLDB in mac terminal to help debug: 
    clang++ -std=c++11 -o test *.cpp 
    lldb ./test input.txt

RUN INSTRUCTIONS
To compile: g++ -std=c++11 -o A1.exe *.cpp
To run: ./A1.exe input.txt
Note: using -std=c++11 as I decided to use tuples to store my vertecies and edges
